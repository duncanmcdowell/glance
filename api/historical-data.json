      "text": "These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption Bitcoin's value has fluctuated widely during its nine-year existence The value of one bitcoin has gone past $10,000 (Â£7,493). \nThe virtual currency reached the benchmark for the first time, just days after it passed $9,000. \nIt caps a remarkable rise in value for the crypto-currency, which was trading below $1,000 at the start of the year. \nSome experts believe the asset still has far to soar , but others say it represents a speculative bubble with nothing tangible at its core that could burst any time. What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush? \nBitcoin first reached $1,000 in late-2013 and then dipped significantly before starting a volatile climb to its current value. \nIt is not entirely clear what has driven the sudden rise in value, especially because the past few weeks have been marked by action by some financial regulators to limit its use. New heights \nOne factor that may have helped was the US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group's announcement at the start of the month that it planned to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of 2017, which bolstered confidence in its prospects. \nAnother was a decision to drop a controversial plan known as Segwit2x. \nThis would have altered the way Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain, worked, to help it handle more transactions. \nBut the move risked splitting the community. \nMany industry watchers believe the rapid rise in value will not be sustained and expect its value to suddenly fall sharply. \nBitcoins were first produced in 2009 and took a long time to become an accepted holder of monetary value that could be swapped for real-world cash. \nOne early transaction involved using 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. \nThe boom has led to a general rise in many other virtual currencies. \nOne, known as Ethereum, is now worth about $480, but at the start of 2017 each one was worth only about $10. \nMany others are also trying to profit from the growing interest in crypto-currencies. Image caption Con artists are sending Bitcoin-based scams to phone users, pretending to be from the news site CoinDesk \nMany malware writers are now seeking to install software on vulnerable websites that create or \"mine\" the coins. \nIn addition, scammers have sent fake text messages to people's phones, claiming they own some of the digital currency, in an effort to tempt them into opening a dangerous link.",

No Ãºltimo domingo (03/12), os investimentos dos gÃªmeos Cameron e Tyler Winklevoss superaram o recorde de US$ 1 bilhÃ£o (cerca de R$ 3,5 bilhÃµes).\nsaiba mais Entenda o que Ã© bitcoin VocÃÂª viu? FuncionÃ¡ria diz que vai se ausentar para cuidar de saÃºde mental e resposta do chefe viraliza Como Ã© a vida de Jeff Bezos 11 maneiras de relaxar de verdade A tacada certeira comeÃ§ou em 2013 quando os irmÃ£os Winklevoss compraram 1% da oferta total de bitcoins por US$ 11 milhÃµes, usando parte da indenizaÃ§Ã£o de US$ 65 milhÃµes que ganharam do dono da maior rede social do mundo. Desde entÃ£o, a moeda criptografada valorizou-se quase 10.000%, fazendo dos gÃªmeos os primeiros bilionÃ¡rios do bitcoin.\nApÃ³s ganharem notoriedade pela disputa com Zuckerberg, os gÃªmeos viraram celebridade. Em outubro de 2015, lanÃ§aram a Gemini Exchange, corretora de bitcoin descrita pelo Financial Times como uma das \"primeiras bolsas de cÃ¢mbio digital reguladas e licenciadas do mundo desenvolvido\". \"NÃ³s queremos construir um mercado semelhante Ã  Nasdaq e Ã  NYSE, sÃ³ que de moeda digital\", declarou Tyler Winklevoss na Ã©poca.\nOs gÃªmeos descrevem o bitcoin como um ativo melhor do que o ouro. A moeda virtual, que surgiu em 2009, teve uma valorizaÃ§Ã£o meteÃ³rica neste ano. Em janeiro de 2017, um bitcoin era vendido abaixo de US$ 1 mil. Hoje, ele vale cerca de US$ 11 mil.\nO valor de mercado total das vÃ¡rias moedas digitais existentes no mundo â alÃ©m do bitcoin, a mais conhecida Ã© a Ethereum â jÃ¡ superou os US$ 290 bilhÃµes, segundo o site especializado Coinmarketcap.com.",

Time Three bitcoin logos on a background of binary code. (Photo: Getty Images) CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Bitcoin broke above the $12,000 mark Wednesday morning Asia-time, as the cryptocurrency continued its march higher. The digital currency quickly leaped further. As of 2:13 p.m., ET, bitcoin traded about 10 percent higher near a record high of $12,917, according to industry site CoinDesk. The bitcoin offshoot, bitcoin cash, traded slightly lower near $1,476, while digital currency ethereum also traded slightly lower near $441, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin began 2017 at less than $1,000 per token, but it has been on an absolute tear in recent months: It crossed $5,000 in October and touched above $11,000 for the first time less than two months later, according to CoinDesk data. With Wednesday morning's spike, bitcoin now has a total market value of about $213 billion â more than twice Goldman Sachs' market cap. All of the digital asset's explosive growth has come against a backdrop of steady criticism from many financial luminaries. More: Federal regulator gives OK for bitcoin futures to trade For one, Stephen Roach, Yale University senior fellow and the former Asia chairman and chief economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley, told CNBC on Tuesday that he was deeply skeptical of investing in bitcoin. \"This is a toxic concept for investors,\" said Roach, who has been described by Yale as one of Wall Street's most influential economists. \"This is a dangerous speculative bubble by any shadow or stretch of the imagination.\" \"I've never seen a chart of a security where the price really has a vertical pattern to it. And bitcoin is the most vertical of any pattern I've ever seen in my career,\" he added. Yet many elements of the financial world have embraced the new crypto asset class: Major exchanges like the CME and CBOE have helped legitimize the currency's investment credentials by saying they plan to introduce futures contracts to their respective exchanges.

      "text": "Marc van der Chijs. Flickr/Marc van der Chijs\nMarc van der Chijs is a Dutch millionaire and crypto entrepreneur who originally made his fortune by founding a video company Alibaba bought for $4 billion. Van der Chijs is fascinated by, and knowledgeable about, bitcoin. He has been invited to Richard Branson's Necker Island to discuss it. He expects that bitcoin's price will reach $150,000 by 2021 â and he says it's not too late to invest.\nA few years ago, Marc van der Chijs wanted to retire and enjoy life.\n\"But that took about six weeks,\" says the serial entrepreneur.\nNow he has set up First Block Capital , a fund that invests in crypto companies. Within two years, Van der Chijs wants to collect a billion dollars.\nHe firmly believes in the digital currency and the underlying technology. \"The blockchain is the engine and the bitcoin the fuel,\" says the Dutch entrepreneur.\nVan der Chijs spoke at the Crypto Investment Summit , a meeting about investing in cryptocurrencies that was held mid-December in Ede, the Netherlands. Trend-watcher and organizer Vincent Everts Skyped with the entrepreneur, who now lives in Vancouver.\nBitcoin will be worth millions Last summer, Van der Chijs predicted that this year the bitcoin would go to the USD $10,000. That has already happened, so Everts wanted a new prediction.\nNo problem. Van der Chijs thinks that the bitcoin exchange rate for the turn of the year is still going to the $15,000. \"There are all kinds of professional investors who want to add it to their portfolio this year, so that they can show that they are in it,\" he explains of his optimism.\nFor 2018, $40,000 is reasonable, he says. \"There is still a great deal of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to participate in this market.\"\nAnd in 2021, a bitcoin will be worth about $150,000. \"I think that the bitcoin can eventually go to the millions of dollars when it becomes a means of payment,\" says Van der Chijs. \"The number of bitcoin is limited to 21 million, so there will never be more than that. But demand will increase exponentially, and so the price will continue to rise.\"\nChinese video king from Arnhem For the money, Van der Chijs doesn't have to go into the bitcoin adventure. He has been a millionaire for a long time by his success in China .\nAfter his studies in business administration in Maastricht, he joined Daimler, the German parent company of Mercedes, as a financial controller and moved to Beijing. He quickly resigned and started working as an independent consultant.\nHis wife Grace introduced him to Gary Wang, a former fellow student of hers at the famous French business school INSEAD. The two men clicked. In 2005, Wang and Van der Chijs founded Tudou, a cross between Netflix and YouTube that became the largest video site in China.\nThe company was listed on the stock exchange in 2011 at a valuation of $822 million. Four years later, internet giant Alibaba bought Tudou for over $4 billion.\nThe second Internet Van der Chijs is not a billionaire, he confessed to Quote: . He is \"only\" a millionaire. But according to him, that is an advantage.\n\"In the billionaires around me, I see that the drive is gone. They are no longer interested in companies in which a few million must be invested,\" Van der Chijs told Quote: . \"Actually, it is an advantage that I am not extremely rich. That is why I think differently. I still have the incentive to invest and to earn from it.\"\nThis was evident in 2013, when Van der Chijs and his wife moved to the Canadian city of Vancouver . The intention was to take it easy, but soon there was situation that demanded Van der Chijs's attention: the financial crisis in Cyprus. Banks on the island blocked customers' accounts to prevent a bank run. And that meant Van der Chijs' company on the island could not access its funds.\nThe incident prompted Van der Chijs to study the financial system and the power of banks. Looking for alternatives, he soon arrived at bitcoin. \"I saw that it was something that changed the world, especially because of the blockchain. That will become a kind of second Internet and turn industries upside down,\" says Van der Chijs.\nBy speaking at conferences, travelling a lot, and building a network, Van der Chijs spreads the bitcoin faith. \"I have done evangelism,\" as he himself calls it. In 2015, he was invited to visit Richard Branson's private island Necker Island to discuss the blockchain with about 150 guests â the only Dutchman invited.\nMarc van der Chijs and Vincent Everts at the Volvo Ocean Race. Flickr/Marc van der Chijs\nTrading in bitcoin on the stock exchange Van der Chijs himself first bought bitcoin when the price was about $100, but now the cryptocurrency is worth more than a hundred times as much. Is it too late to invest in bitcoin?\n\"No, not at all. I still buy bitcoin myself,\" says Van der Chijs. \"It is still relatively cheap, because in the end the price goes up to the million dollars. So if you just hold onto it, you're going to earn a lot of money. I am sure of that.\"\nHe has hardly any other cryptocurrencies in his portfolio. \"I am a bitcoin maximalist, as it is called. I have some ethereum, some monero, some ripple, some zcash. But I think bitcoin is the best coin in the long term.\"\nFor that to happen, it must become easier to trade bitcoin. Almost the only way to do that now is by buying the currency, holding it, and selling it again later. However, there will soon be futures on the market , allowing you to trade on the price without actually having the scarce digital coins in your possession.\n\"Institutional investors are more likely to have exposure to bitcoin,\" says Van der Chijs, who will soon be listing his crypto-investment fund. \"Then it is possible for large funds to buy bitcoin in a liquid way.\"\nPaying with bitcoin is still far away Bitcoin only becomes truly established when you can also buy your coffee with it â and that is precisely the bottleneck of the current software.\nThe computer network is currently able to process only 10 transactions per second, a lot less than, say, the credit card company Visa, which processes 2,000 payments every second. As a result, the costs of a bitcoin transaction have increased considerably.\nA solution for this is the lightning network , an extra layer of software on top of the blockchain that enables faster transactions. Van der Chijs expects the technique to be added to the bitcoin software in a few months' time. Then the sky is the limit.\nThe first banks will add crypto accounts in 2018, thinks Van der Chijs. Then you can convert your euros or dollars into bitcoin at the touch of a button. \"That makes sure that even more people come into contact with it,\" he says. \"And that means that the price will continue to rise.\"\nMore from Business Insider Netherlands The best movie of every year since 2000, according to critics BlackRockâs $1.7 trillion bond chief tells us the most important force driving markets A cute dog invaded a Europa League pitch, disrupted the game, and got petted by a player Get the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\n Business Insider Nederland Business Insider Nederland on Twitter .\nSEE ALSO: A 39-year-old who sold everything he owned in exchange for bitcoin now lives on a campsite waiting for the ultimate cryptoboom NOW WATCH: Cryptocurrency is the next step in the digitization of everything â 'Itâs sort of inevitable' More: Business Insider Nederland BI International Bitcoin Marc van der Chijs Cryptocurrencies Blockchain",

      "text": "Shutterstock\nLitecoin kicks off the week with another major jump, putting its year-to-date growth at 4,315 percent. \nLast Thursday, Litecoin jumped from trading between $90-100 to $120-130â a leap of 38 percent in just 9 hours . Over the weekend, the price fluctuated around the $150 mark, kicking off at $144.61 yesterday, according to CoinMarketCap .\nThis morning, Litecoin prices hit $186.87, marking a staggering 29 percent jump in less than 24 hours. At the time of this writing, the price is listed at $186.56 on CoinMarketCap.\nCoinMarketCap Litecoin's 24 Hour Rise (in USD)\nWhy the Surge? Several factors may be contributing to the explosive growth of Litecoin.\n\nThe recent launch of Bitcoin futures trading on Cboe caused a spike in Bitcoin prices . As Charles Bovaird notes , Litecoin's behavior tends to have a direct relationship to Bitcoin's. Especially as network speeds lag and transaction fees soar on Bitcoin, Litecoin may be an appealing trading alternative with its faster speeds and lower transaction costs.\nCoinbase, the popular cryptocurrency brokerage, has also ballooned in user base alongside the growth of Bitcoin, recently surpassing YouTube as the #1 app on the Apple App Store . Coinbase currently only supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoinâso the positive relationship between Bitcoin and Litecoin might be putting a special spotlight on Litecoin amid the rapid growth of Coinbase.\nThere is also speculation that Litecoin creator Charlie Lee's recent media blitz, appearing on Squawk Alley and Glenn Beck, is contributing to its rapid ascent in price, giving him a pedestal to pitch Litecoin as the currency of fast transactions and daily use.",

      "text": "by williambanzai7 - Dec 15, 2017 9:38 PM \nIn one picture... by Tim Knight from... - Dec 15, 2017 11:41 PM \nBitcoin no more deserves to be as worth as much as all the gold in the world as I deserve to have the same net worth as Mark Zuckerberg. by Sprott Money - Dec 16, 2017 7:58 AM \nSo, what is really keeping Mr. Poloz up at night? Three possibilities come to mind. It's Official: Bitcoin Surpasses \"Tulip Mania\", Is Now The Biggest Bubble In World History Dec 13, 2017 4:16 AM 0 SHARES \nOne month ago, a chart from Convoy Investments went viral for showing that among all of the world's most famous asset bubbles, bitcoin was only lagging the infamous 17th century \"Tulip Mania.\" \nOne month later, the price of bitcoin has exploded even higher, and so it is time to refresh where in the global bubble race bitcoin now stands, and also whether it has finally surpassed \"Tulips.\" \nConveniently, overnight the former Bridgewater analysts Howard Wang and Robert Wu who make up Convoy, released the answer in the form of an updated version of their asset bubble chart. In the new commentary, Wang writes that the Bitcoin prices have again more than doubled since the last update, and \"its price has now gone up over 17 times this year, 64 times over the last three years and superseded that of the Dutch Tulipâs climb over the same time frame .\" \nThat's right: as of this moment it is official that bitcoin is now the biggest bubble in history, having surpassed the Tulip Mania of 1634-1637. \nAnd with that we can say that crypto pioneer Mike Novogratz was right once again when he said that \" This is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes .\" Which, of course, does not stop him from investing hundreds of millions in the space: when conceding that cryptos are the biggest bubble ever, \"Novo\" also said he expects bitcoin to hit $40,000 and ethereum to triple to $1,500. \n\" Bitcoin could be at $40,000 at the end of 2018. It easily could ,\" Novogratz said Monday on CNBC's \"Fast Money .\" \" Ethereum, which I think just touched $500 or is getting close, could be triple where it is as well.\" \nAs for Wang, here are some additional observations: \nI continue this topic and discuss a main driver of bubbles. When we see a dramatic rise in asset prices, there is often an internal struggle between the two types of investors within us. The first is the value investor, âis this investment getting too expensive?â The second is the momentum investor, âam I missing out on a trend?â I believe the balance of these two approaches, both within ourselves and across a market, ultimately determines the propensity for bubble-like behavior. When there is a new or rapidly evolving market, our conviction in the value investor can weaken and the momentum investor can take over. Other markets that structurally lack a basis for valuation are even more susceptible to momentum swings because the main indicator of future value is the marketâs perception of recent value. \nWe will publish the balance of Wang's full note \"What causes asset bubbles?\" shortly, but for now we just wanted to experience a moment of true zen serenity, knowing that we now stand in proximity to an asset bubble the magnitude of which has never before been observed by humanity. Thanks central banks! ",

      "text": "Shutterstock\nRipple seizes the #4 spot with $18B market cap.\nAlongside major developments in Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, other altcoins are beginning to gain traction in the broader eye. One such coin is Ripple (XRP), a cryptocurrency known for its connection with the banking world.\n24 hours ago, the price of XRP was $0.27. Earlier this morning (PST), it hit $0.51âan increase of 84 percent. At the time of this writing the price is $0.46 ( CoinMarketCap ).\nWhat you need to know about Ripple\nAlongside its cryptocurrency, Ripple operates as a payment network called RippleNet. The goal of the platform is to optimize easy transfer of fundsâto almost any other currency or cryptocurrency in the world in 4 seconds. Ripple is working with banks and financial institutions to become the premier cryptocurrency of record, offering a quick, cost-effective way to transfer funds globally.\nFor example, if you wanted to send your friend in Italy $50, you could trade for $50 worth of XRP, and they could quickly trade that out for Euros.\nSo why has XRP gone up so quickly?\nThe increased activity in Bitcoin following Cboe launching bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 10, is generating more activity around the entire cryptocurrency world. As the #4 (and occasionally #5 when Litecoin surpassed it) cryptocurrency, of course Ripple has felt the, well, ripple effect.",

      "text": "Bitcoin is becoming increasingly illiquid. As more people buy bitcoin, the network becomes congested and transaction times get longer. Transaction fees are getting higher, too. This will be a real problem if the price crashes and everyone tries to get out at the same time.\nThis chart shows a seven-day average of the total number of minutes it takes to confirm a bitcoin transaction , since May 2016.\nLike the price of bitcoin itself, transaction time has been rising as the months go by. Right now, it takes four and a half hours to confirm a bitcoin trade, on average.\nBlockchain Luxembourg SARL\nIf you are holding bitcoin and worried that the price â which cleared $17,000 last week â is a bubble, then bitcoin transaction times should really start to scare you.\nThe price of bitcoin is shifting up and down by hundreds or thousands of dollars each day. No one knows what the price will be one hour from now â but we know it will be very, very different.\nAnd the schedule for the world's largest initial coin offering, the $500 million Dragon casino offering , has been pushed back two weeks .\n\"Due to the extreme congestion on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum Networks, ICO investors or contributors have faced significant challenges when transferring their Bitcoin and Ethereum to participate in the Dragon Pre-ICO,\" it said in a press release.\nThe transaction time is built into the system, as each transaction must be confirmed by six bitcoin miners . There is a finite number of them, and the more transactions they have to confirm, the longer it takes as their network bandwidth fills.\nWorse, they charge for transactions and prioritize transactions based on price. Those who pay more get processed first.\nMarkets Insider\nImagine how bad this would get on a day some negative news hits the wires and the significant holders of bitcoin decide \"I've had enough of this, I've made my money, I am bailing.\" The majority of bitcoins are held by a tiny percentage of the market â 40% by 1,000 people . Those few holders could crash the market whenever they wanted.\nAs anyone who remembers the market crashes of 2000 and 2008 knows, these things happen fast. Billions get wiped from the market in minutes. People who need to cash out now but are an hour or so behind the news can lose their shirts.\nIt is brutal.\nAnd blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin, just isn't equipped to deal with it.\nPart of the increase in transaction time has no doubt been caused by the recent arrival of new, less knowledgeable investors coming into the market only because they have seen the headlines about the price of bitcoin going up, up, up.\nThat gives us an idea of just how congested it is likely to be on the way down.\nIt would also be expensive. By some counts, transaction fees are doubling every three months . Ars Technica reported that fees recently reached $26 a trade .\nThose fees would compound the losses of people trying to sell in a crash.\nBy comparison, stockbrokers and banks transact trades in less than a second, usually for less than $10.\nTo get an idea of how comically difficult it is to get out of bitcoin, read this chain of tweets from a Google engineer whose screen name is @TedOnPrivacy.\n\"I had to send pictures of my driving license and passport to some random website, which for all I know could be about as trustworthy as MtGox ,\" he wrote. \"I had enough time to eat lunch while waiting for the transaction to confirm, though, so this was nice, I had roasted avocado with an egg.\"\nIt took him days.\n\"Is it really money if you can't use it nor convert it to anything else,\" he lamented.\nI'm trying to sell some of my Bitcoin, and the whole process is so terrible, it's almost hilarious.\nâ Ted (@TedOnPrivacy) December 12, 2017 Get the latest Bitcoin price here.>>\nSEE ALSO: Now there is a way for contagion from a bitcoin price collapse to flow into the rest of the markets DON'T MISS: This is the tech bubble we have been waiting for NOW WATCH: Why airlines ask you to raise the window shades for takeoffs and landings More: Bitcoin Blockchain Finance",
